*Formal verification* involves the use of logical and computational methods to establish claims that are expressed in
precise mathematical terms. These can include ordinary mathematical theorems, as well as claims that pieces of hardware
or software, network protocols, and mechanical and hybrid systems meet their specifications. In practice, there is not a
sharp distinction between verifying a piece of mathematics and verifying the correctness of a system: formal
verification requires describing hardware and software systems in mathematical terms, at which point establishing claims
as to their correctness becomes a form of theorem proving. Conversely, the proof of a mathematical theorem may require a
lengthy computation, in which case verifying the truth of the theorem requires verifying that the computation does what
it is supposed to do.
