# Cutting Planes with Lean 4

*by Bernardo Borges*

This book is the official documentation for the usage of the [lean-cutting-planes](https://github.com/bernborgess/lean-cutting-planes) library. It is currently a work in progress, with the goal to provide full expressivity in Lean 4 for the cutting planes formal logic.

It consists of 6 rules, as in:

<!-- Inline -->
\\( \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C \\)

<!-- Block -->
\\[ \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0} x_i \\]
