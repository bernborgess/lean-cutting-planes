# Cutting Planes with Lean 4

*by Bernardo Borges*

This book is the official documentation for the usage of the [lean-cutting-planes](https://github.com/bernborgess/lean-cutting-planes) library. It is currently a work in progress, with the goal to provide full expressivity in Lean 4 for the cutting planes formal logic.

Future work in this project will aim to verify unsat demonstrations that were produced by solvers suchs as [RoundingSat](https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/roundingsat) and check that their reasoning was correct.
